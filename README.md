# IDX Oil & Gas Companies Performance Infographic

Welcome to the Oil & Gas Companies Performance Infographic project! This project aims to visualize the financial performance of companies in the oil & gas sector that are registered on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). Using R programming language, we have developed an infographic that provides insights into revenue growth, Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of these companies.

## Motivation
The oil & gas industry plays a significant role in the global economy, and understanding the financial performance of companies within this sector is crucial for investors, analysts, and stakeholders. By creating this infographic, we aim to provide a clear and concise overview of key financial metrics for oil & gas companies listed on the IDX.

## Features
Developed using R, we showed 3 significant values here:
- **Revenue Growth**: Revenue growth refers to the percentage increase in a company's total revenue over a specific period compared to a previous period. It is a key indicator of a company's ability to increase its sales over time and is often used to assess the company's overall health and performance.

- **P/E Ratio** (Price-to-Earnings Ratio): The P/E ratio is a financial metric used to evaluate a company's current stock price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). It is calculated by dividing the current market price of a company's stock by its earnings per share (EPS). The P/E ratio indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings. A higher P/E ratio may suggest that investors expect higher earnings growth in the future, while a lower P/E ratio may indicate undervaluation or lower growth expectations.

- **P/B Ratio** (Price-to-Book Ratio): The P/B ratio is a financial metric used to compare a company's market value (price) to its book value (shareholders' equity). It is calculated by dividing the market price per share by the book value per share. The P/B ratio provides insights into whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its assets. A P/B ratio below 1 may suggest that a stock is undervalued, while a P/B ratio above 1 may indicate overvaluation. However, the interpretation of P/B ratio depends on the industry and other factors, so it should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics for analysis.
